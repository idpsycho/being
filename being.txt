background - green grass
thing - circle, color, name, position, direction, box2d, radius
input - moving locked thing
camera - locking, mouse movement
everything should be encapsulated in kind of modular way for simplicity
tree - static green thing
animal - simple random movement ai, health (later view-angle)
human - hunger, health (somehow show it in gui), inventory
meat - what goes out of animal
rock - lays around on ground, nonphysic, throwable, does damage
things should have their definitions (with universal object generator)
ability to play with as any object
	human - movement, take/drop, throw, eat
	animal - movement, health, survival
	rock - do nothing, but camera follows it, and it may has some stats
